## Direct Access

When you have found the data you want to use, you have two options.  You can download the data to work locally, or access the data directly to work in the cloud. This second way of working is called "_Direct Cloud Access_" or simply, "_Direct Access_". Your compute instance needs to be in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Region `us-west-2` in order for the code to run successfully. We authenticate using a netrc file and an Earthdata Login, see the [appendix](../appendix/authentication.qmd) for more information on [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/) and netrc setup.

## Python

We can use the [`earthaccess`](https://nsidc.github.io/earthaccess/) python library to grab the file URLs and then access them with the `xarray` library. 


```{python}
#Import packages
import earthaccess
import xarray as xr

#Authentication with Earthdata Login
auth = earthaccess.login(strategy="netrc")

#Access land ice height from ATLAS/ICESat-2 V005 (10.5067/ATLAS/ATL06.005), searching for data over western Greenland coast over two weeks in July 2022. The data are provided as HDF5 granules (files) that span about 1/14th of an orbit.

results = earthaccess.search_data(short_name="ATL06",
                                  version="005",
                                  cloud_hosted=True,
                                  temporal = ("2022-07-17","2022-07-31"),
                                  bounding_box = (-51.96423,68.10554,-48.71969,70.70529))

#Use xarray to load the data as a multifile dataset for a single group in the HDF5 file, in this case land ice segments:
ds = xr.open_mfdataset(earthaccess.open(results), group='/gt1l/land_ice_segments')
ds
```


## R

## End User License Agreement (EULA)

Sometimes, accessing data in NASA Earthdata Cloud requires an End-User License Agreement (EULA). If you cannot access a dataset, this may be your issue! See [these instructions](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/documentation/for_users/how_to_preauth_app) for how to authorize EULAs.
