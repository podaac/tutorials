    "This Jupyter Notebook contains examples related to querying the *HUC Feature Translation Service (FTS)*, previewing (viusualizing) the queried region of interest, and using FTS results to query NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Case:** \n",
    "Check if data is available over my region of interest using HUCs. In this example we are using FTS to geospatially define our region of interest, namely the Upper Tuolumne River Basin in the San Joaquin River Basin in California's Sierra Nevada, searching by HUC or region name, and then using those geospatial bounds (coordinates) to query Sentinel-1 data in CMR.\n",
    "1. use FTS to define geographic region of interest (query by partial or exact HUC or HUC region name)\n",
    "2. preview query \n",
    "3. use coordinates returned by FTS to query Sentinel-1 data in CMR, by polygon or bounding box.\n",

    "USGS Hydrologic unit map to help identifiy region of interest (e.g. HUC value or name) can be found here: https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/regions.html "

    "Below are two examples of how to visualize the response from the Feature Translation Service. As of now, without support from the Earthdata search client, there's no easy way to glean whether your response _is_ indeed correct. So, here I provide code that takes a response from the HUC Feature Translation Service, and graphs the associated bounding boxes, convex hull polygons, and Visvalingam-Whyatt polygons."
