## SWOT Background

The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission aims to provide valuable data and information about the world's oceans and its terrestrial surface water such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands. SWOT is being developed jointly by NASA and Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA). The satellite launched on December 16, 2022 and data is expected to be released to the public no earlier than Fall 2023. PO.DAAC is the NASA archive for the SWOT mission, and will be making data available via the NASA Earthdata Cloud (hosted in AWS) with direct download capabilities available. More information can be found on [PO.DAAC's SWOT webpage](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT).

PO.DAAC will host a variety of [SWOT data products](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT?tab=datasets). Their product description documents can be found in the chart listing each dataset. Before these SWOT products are available, we have [SWOT simulated datasets](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT?tab=datasets&sections=about%2Bdata) encompassing both oceanography and hydrology sample data. This data is not for analysis, but rather to become comfortable with future SWOT products data formats and access mechanisms.

### 2022 SWOT Ocean Cloud Workshop

[**https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/**](https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/){.uri}

The goal of the workshop was to enable the (oceanography) science team to be ready for processing and handling the large volumes of SWOT SSH data in the cloud. Learning objectives focus on how to access the [simulated SWOT L2 SSH data](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/announcements/2022-01-31-Release-simulated-SWOT-SSH-version1-datasets) from Earthdata Cloud either by downloading or accessing the data on the cloud.
