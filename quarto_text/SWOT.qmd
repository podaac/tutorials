## SWOT Background

The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission aims to provide valuable data and information about the world's oceans and its terrestrial surface water such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands. SWOT is jointly developed by NASA and Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA). The satellite launched on December 16, 2022. PO.DAAC is the NASA archive for the SWOT mission, and has made data available via the NASA Earthdata Cloud (hosted in AWS) with direct download capabilities available. PO.DAAC hosts a variety of [SWOT data products](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT?tab=datasets-information), whose product description documents can be found in the chart listing each dataset. More information can be found on [PO.DAAC's SWOT webpage](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT).

## SWOT Data Resources & Tutorials

### Search & Download

#### **Via Graphical User Interface:**

- Find/download [SWOT data on Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=swot*1.1*)

#### **Programmatically:** ie. within Python code workflows

- [Search and Download via `earthaccess`](../notebooks/SearchDownload_SWOTviaCMR.ipynb)
- [with unique SWORD river reach ID](../notebooks/SWORD_River_Demo.ipynb)* 
- [with unique Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) basin ID](../notebooks/HUC Feature Translation Service Examples-updated-20210804.ipynb)*

*Note: these notebooks will be updated once pre-validated data is available, there is a known spatial search issue with beta pre-validated data.

#### **Via Command Line** - PO.DAAC subscriber/downloader examples: 

Hydrology: *These examples will download either the river vector files or the raster files:* 
``` bash
podaac-data-downloader -c SWOT_L2_HR_RiverSP_1.1 -d ./SWOT_L2_HR_RiverSP_1.1/ --start-date 2023-04-08T00:00:00Z --end-date 2023-04-25T23:59:59Z
```
    
```bash
podaac-data-downloader -c SWOT_L2_HR_Raster_1.1 -d ./SWOT_L2_HR_Raster_1.1/ --start-date 2023-04-08T00:00:00Z --end-date 2023-04-25T23:59:59Z
```

Oceanography: *These examples will download modeled sea surface heights for the whole SSH collection and then the anomalies using the subscriber then downloader:*
    
``` bash
podaac-data-subscriber -c SWOT_L2_LR_SSH_1.1 -d ./SWOT_L2_LR_SSH_1.1/ --start-date 2023-03-29T00:00:00Z

#### **SWOT Spatial Coverage for Beta Pre-Validated Products v1.1**

To identify spatial coverage/search terms for the Beta Pre-Validated products (v1.1), PO.DAAC has created a KMZ file that has layers of the SWOT passes, tiles, scenes, and basins covered in this product release. Spatial coverage will expand for the pre-validated product release. Each layer has direct links to Earthdata Search (the ‘Open URL’ link) and CMR (the ‘Get CSV’ link) results for the corresponding files. The passes layer has useful information for all SWOT products, the tiles layer is useful for the L1B_HR_SLC, L2_HR_PIXC, and L2_HR_PIXCVec products, the scenes layer is useful for the L2_HR_Raster product (screenshot below), and the basins layer gives the L2_HR_RiverSP and L2_HR_LakeSP product coverages for each continent/pass combination.

Click here to download Beta Pre-Validated HR Product KMZ file. The file can be opened in the Google Earth desktop application and viewed like the following:

#### **Tips for SWOT HR Spatial Search**

To support spatial search of SWOT HR data products, the following naming conventions may be of help. *Tip: use these shortname identifiers below when searching for SWOT HR data in the [NASA Earthdata Search portal](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/) or programmatically using the CMR API and/or `earthaccess` python library.*

SWOT HR data products use Tiles, Scenes, or Continent-level Swaths IDs depending on the product, which define the spatial extent of what is in each file, as follows in the chart below. Along-track scene and tile numbers are numbered sequentially following the spacecraft flight direction, so the numbers increase from south to north for ascending passes and from north to south for descending passes. See [SWOT Spatial Coverage Section](#swot-spatial-coverage-for-beta-pre-validated-products-v1.1) above for information to find the pass, tile or scene numbers.

In [Earthdata Search GUI](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search):

1. Use the top left Search Box and search with keywords, e.g. SWOT L2 HR 
2. Select a collection of interest
3. A Filter Granule filtering capability will show up on the left hand side of the GUI. Recall naming convention is `_cycle_pass_spatialIdentifier_`. 
    - Use **wildcards** to narrow down spatially, using one of the codes from the table above depending on your use case. *Tip: use underscores ( _ ) with your wildcard key words for a more specific search.*
    - Example: `*_NA_*` will filter the RiverSP or LakeSP collection selected to only return those granules (files) that are part of the North America collection
    - Example: `*_004_256_*` will filter the RiverSP or LakeSP collection selected to only return those granules (files) that correspond to cycle 004, pass 256
    - Example: `*_004_253_128*` will filter the Raster collection selected to only return those granules (files) that correspond to cycle 004, pass 253, scene 128
4. In addition, you can also draw a **region of interest (ROI)** on the map, using the Spatial Search Filter icon or the Advanced Search under the main search box. These will help to filter what is returned for the spatial search. *Tip: It is recommended that ROI searches are used together with wildcards described above for a more accurate search.*

### 2022 SWOT Ocean Cloud Workshop

[**https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/**](https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/){.uri}

The goal of the workshop was to enable the (oceanography) science team to be ready for processing and handling the large volumes of SWOT SSH data in the cloud. Learning objectives focus on how to access the [simulated SWOT L2 SSH data](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/announcements/2022-01-31-Release-simulated-SWOT-SSH-version1-datasets) from Earthdata Cloud either by downloading or accessing the data on the cloud.
