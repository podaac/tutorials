## SWOT Background

The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission aims to provide valuable data and information about the world's oceans and its terrestrial surface water such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands. SWOT is jointly developed by NASA and Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA). The satellite launched on December 16, 2022. PO.DAAC is the NASA archive for the SWOT mission, and has made data available via the NASA Earthdata Cloud (hosted in AWS) with direct download capabilities available. PO.DAAC hosts a variety of [SWOT data products](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT?tab=datasets-information), whose product description documents can be found in the chart listing each dataset. More information can be found on [PO.DAAC's SWOT webpage](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT) and the [SWOT Data User Handbook](https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-docs/web-misc/swot_mission_docs/D-109532_SWOT_UserHandbook_20240502.pdf). Refer to this [Mission Events](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT-events/SWOT_events.html) page for relevant information about spacecraft events that impact data quality and availability. To give feedback or ask questions on data products, post in this [Earthdata Forum topic](https://forum.earthdata.nasa.gov/viewtopic.php?t=5270).

## SWOT Data Resources & Tutorials

### **Search & Download**

#### **Search SWOT Passes over Time**

CNES developed this dedicated visualization tool for a quick look at where SWOT has been, where it is, and where it will be. Once you have selected the area of interest, click the Search button to search for SWOT passes. The results are displayed in a table and the swaths that intersect the area of interest are displayed on the map. Click on the marker to view the pass number.

To launch the Binder application, click on this [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CNES/search_swot/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fmain.ipynb).

To launch jupyterlab in Binder, clink on this [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CNES/search_swot/HEAD?labpath=notebook.ipynb).

*Note: The Binder versions of this are for casual quick looks, but we recommend for extensive use to access the Jupyter Notebook directly [here](https://github.com/CNES/search_swot/blob/master/notebook.ipynb).*

#### **SWOT Spatial Coverage**

To identify spatial coverage/search terms for the science 21-day orbit, PO.DAAC has created a KMZ file that has layers of the SWOT passes and tiles, with corresponding scene numbers identified in the pop-up when a location is selected (see screenshot below). Each layer has direct links to Earthdata Search results (the ‘search’ links) for corresponding files. The passes layer has useful information for all SWOT products, but links to the LR products specifically, the tiles layer is useful for HR products (L1B_HR_SLC, L2_HR_PIXC, and L2_HR_PIXCVec products use tile spatial extents while the L2_HR_Raster product uses scenes. L2_HR_RiverSP and L2_HR_LakeSp use continent-level passes). 

To **download the KMZ file**, for the **science 21-day orbit, [click here](https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-docs/web-misc/swot_mission_docs/swot_science_coverage_20240319.kmz)**. 

For the Beta Pre-validated data KMZ that used the **cal/val 1-day orbit, [click here](https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-docs/web-misc/swot_mission_docs/swot_beta_preval_coverage_20231204.kmz)**.

These files can be opened in the Google Earth desktop application and viewed like the following:

<nop/> <div style="width: 700px;">![Screenshot of pass and tile layer in spatial coverage KMZ file viewed in the Google Earth Desktop application](../images/science_orbit_SWOT_KMZ_scene.png)</div>

The KaRIN HR Masks true/false text pop up for tiles comes from the two different masks used for different parts of the year. The 'Seasonal' mask is used from Dec 1st to March 1st and removes part of the Canadian archipelago coverage to collect additional data over sea ice instead, indicated by true/false statements.

#### **Tips for SWOT Spatial Search**

To support spatial search of SWOT data products, the following naming conventions may be of help. *Tip: use these shortname identifiers below when searching for SWOT data in the [NASA Earthdata Search portal](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/) or programmatically using the CMR API and/or `earthaccess` python library.*

SWOT HR data products use Tiles, Scenes, or Continent-level Swaths IDs depending on the product, which define the spatial extent of what is in each file, as follows in the chart below. Along-track scene and tile numbers are numbered sequentially following the spacecraft flight direction, so the numbers increase from south to north for ascending passes and from north to south for descending passes. SWOT LR products use global swaths and nadir tracks that use pass numbers. See [SWOT Spatial Coverage Section](#swot-spatial-coverage) above for information to find the pass, tile or scene numbers.

| Product (organized by…)                             | File Naming  Convention | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |   |   |

In [Earthdata Search GUI](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search):

1. Use the top left Search Box and search with keywords, e.g. SWOT L2 HR 
2. Select a collection of interest
3. A Filter Granule filtering capability will show up on the left hand side of the GUI. Recall naming convention is `_cycle_pass_spatialIdentifier_`. 
    - Use **wildcards** to narrow down spatially, using one of the codes from the table above depending on your use case. *Tip: use underscores ( _ ) with your wildcard key words for a more specific search.*
    - Example: `*_NA_*` will filter the RiverSP or LakeSP collection selected to only return those granules (files) that are part of the North America collection
    - Example: `*_004_256_*` will filter the RiverSP or LakeSP collection selected to only return those granules (files) that correspond to cycle 004, pass 256
    - Example: `*_004_253_128*` will filter the Raster collection selected to only return those granules (files) that correspond to cycle 004, pass 253, scene 128
4. In addition, you can also draw a **region of interest (ROI)** on the map, using the Spatial Search Filter icon or the Advanced Search under the main search box. These will help to filter what is returned for the spatial search. *Tip: It is recommended that ROI searches are used together with wildcards described above for a more accurate search.*

### **Tools**

[Hydrocron](https://podaac.github.io/hydrocron/intro.html) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11193245.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11193245) - an API that repackages the river shapefile dataset (L2_HR_RiverSP) into csv or GeoJSON formats that make time-series analysis easier. SWOT data is archived as individually timestamped shapefiles, which would otherwise require users to perform potentially thousands of file operations per river feature to view the data as a timeseries. Hydrocron makes this possible with a single API call. 

[SWODLR](https://github.com/podaac/swodlr) - a system for generating on demand raster products from SWOT L2 raster data with custom resolutions, projections, and extents. *-in development*

### **SWORD of Science**

The SWORD of Science (SoS) is a community-driven dataset produced for and from the execution of the Confluence workflow which is a cloud-based workflow that executes on SWOT observations to produce river discharge parameter estimates. Data granules contain two files, priors and results. The priors file contains prior information, such as in-situ gauge data and model output that is used to generate the discharge products. The results file contains the resulting river discharge data products.
