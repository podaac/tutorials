### **Notebooks**
- [Introduction to Dask Tutorial](../notebooks/Advanced_cloud/basic_dask.ipynb) - covers the basics of using Dask for parallel computing with NASA Earth Data completely in the cloud
- [Function Replication Example](../notebooks/Advanced_cloud/dask_delayed01.ipynb) - demonstrates a more complex example of replicating a function over many files in parallel using `dask.delayed()`. The example analysis generates spatial correlation maps of sea surface temperature vs sea surface height, using data sets available on PO.DAAC.
