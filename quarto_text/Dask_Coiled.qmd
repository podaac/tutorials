title: Dask and Coiled
subtitle: Utilize CPU's in parallel on your cloud virtual machine to speed up computations with Python's `dask` package. Or, combine many VM's together in a distributed cluster for parallel computations using `Coiled`.

### **Notebooks**
- [Introduction to Dask Tutorial](../notebooks/Advanced_cloud/basic_dask.ipynb) - covers the basics of using Dask for parallel computing with NASA Earth Data completely in the cloud
- [Dask Function Replication Example](../notebooks/Advanced_cloud/dask_delayed_01.ipynb) - demonstrates a more complex example of replicating a function over many files in parallel using `dask.delayed()`. The example analysis generates spatial correlation maps of sea surface temperature vs sea surface height, using data sets available on PO.DAAC.
- [Coiled Function Replication Example](../notebooks/Advanced_cloud/coiled_function_01.ipynb) - demonstrates a more complex example of replicating a function over many files in parallel using `coiled.function()`. The example analysis generates spatial correlation maps of sea surface temperature vs sea surface height, using data sets available on PO.DAAC.
