### Use the Handbook

Please first see the [SWOT Data User Handbook](https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-docs/web-misc/swot_mission_docs/D-109532_SWOT_UserHandbook_20240502.pdf?_ga=2.76536725.1816513343.1724259518-1354658737.1715875596) sections 3.3.2 for the ITRF, 3.3.3 on the reference ellipsoid and 11.3.1 on the geoid. In addition, section 3.1.23 gives detailed information about Height with section 3.1.24 elaborating on Sea Surface Height Anomalies and 3.1.25 elaborating on Water Surface Elevation over inland waters.

As a summary, SWOT data is referenced to the WGS84 reference ellipsoid as a first step, and in a second step referenced to the EGM2008 geoid that references WGS84 for the vertical datum. To get a direct conversion with another dataset, it is easiest to transform all local data to the EGM2008 geoid. For the horizontal datum, SWOT uses ITRF 2014 in reference to the WGS84 reference ellipsoid. We recognize these conversions are different globally and depending on the data being used to compare, but we are collecting community examples of direct comparisons to share below:
