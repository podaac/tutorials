## Background

The Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) was established in 2002 to foster an international focus and coordination for the development of a new generation of global, multi-sensor, high-resolution near real time SST datasets. It brings together international space agencies, research institutes, universities, and government agencies to collectively address the scientific, logistical and managerial challenges posed by creating the SST datasets and services within the Project. The overall aim of the GHRSST is to provide the best quality sea surface temperature data for applications in short, medium and decadal/climate time scales in the most cost effective and efficient manner through international collaboration and scientific innovation.
