## Background

The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite is designed to principally measure soil moisture and freeze/thaw state from space for all non-liquid water surfaces globally within the top layer of the Earth. The mission additionally provides a value-added Level 4 terrestrial carbon dataset derived from SMAP observations.
More information can be found on [PO.DAAC's SMAP webpage](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SMAP).
